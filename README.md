# leaflet-challenge
The purpose of this project was to visualize both depth and magntitude of recent earthquakes as well as their location. Data is pulled from the a USGS API endpoint that shows all earthquakes across the world in the past seven days that updates ever minute: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

To view the website:

1. Open a browswer and navigate to: https://dkogel.github.io/leaflet-challenge/
1. Click on one of the circles and observe that it displays the location and magnitude of the associated earthquake
1. Observe that legend on the right hand side of the page shows the depth of the earthquake associated with the color of the circle

Website will look similar to this:
